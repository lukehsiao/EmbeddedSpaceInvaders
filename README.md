# Embedded Space Invaders #

This implementation of Space Invaders is made for the Digilent [ATLYS Development Board](http://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?NavPath=2,400,836&Prod=ATLYS&CFID=6868855&CFTOKEN=8a46aff22a6e7e36-78556F94-5056-0201-024A395AE56BA1E9). The hardware and software is organized into their own respective folders.

### Where can I find more details? ###
Implementation and game details can be found here: [Embedded Space Invaders Guide](http://www.et.byu.edu/~lhsiao/EmbeddedSpaceInvadersGuide.pdf).

In addition, we built our own Programmable Interval Timer (PIT) Timer to allow us to change the speed of the game using software. The documentation on the PIT Timer can be found here: [PIT Timer Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FLlpl3VlGg6HEzMFWNjEoGZLIr2TKnlceqyeuxR4R50/edit?usp=sharing).

We also included an IP Module to interface with a HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Rangefinder. Documentation on this IP Module can be found here: [Rangefinder IP Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15ezw_1CJ3mSIxeJryx1Dmh0uWOIbMw_ZgiXK8Hpnbd4/edit?usp=sharing).
