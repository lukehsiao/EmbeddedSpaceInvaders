### What is this repository for? ###

Good version control.  We've organized it into two folders, hardware and software.  These are for source files only.

Use path *C:\Lab* for all projects!!!

### Versioning Guidelines ###
We will use a vX.X.X versioning guideline.  We will call v1.0.0 the final version for lab 3, v2.0.0 the final for lab 4, etc.  Each final, stable lab version will increment the major version number. 

We will try to follow the "Fork and Pull" model of revision control.
